For this mini test project, we can create a discord bot and use the generative AI google library to have a personnal assitant that we can invite to our discord chat/servers

After clonning the project:
 1- create a .env file
 2- Go to [discord developper portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new app and copy it's key to the: CLIENT_TOKEN
 3- Go to [google AI dev](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) and create a new APi key to copy into: GOOGLE_KEY
 4- npm install
 5- node index.js

 You also need to give permissions to your discord bot from the developper portal and invite it to your chat/servers

how to use the bot:
 1- !ping (to test if the bot is alive and responding)
 2- !chat [your message]
 3- timer [work time] [break time]
